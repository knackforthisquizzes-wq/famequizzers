      <p>
        People don’t usually notice when attention starts shaping identity, it happens gradually.
        Decisions begin orbiting relevance. Quiet starts feeling like failure.
        Or, in healthier cases, attention stays useful but optional.
        This quiz maps where you’d likely land once visibility stops being temporary.

      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Fame doesn’t just change schedules, it pressures self-concept.
        Your result isn’t a diagnosis. It’s a snapshot of how attention might interact with your identity

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is it bad if attention feels important to me?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not automatically. It gets risky when sense of value collapses without it.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “fused” mean here?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It means attention has started to steer sense of value or direction, not just amplify it.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can people move between these patterns?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Stress, success, wear, and boundaries can shift the balance over time.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Use it as a filter. The next phase zooms out to scale: what happens when success grows past normal life.
