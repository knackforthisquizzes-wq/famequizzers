<h1>What Would Dim Your Shine First?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Sustained attention doesn’t crash in one dramatic moment — it quietly overcharges one specific part of you.
    This quiz reveals what would dull your glow first once fame becomes routine:
    velvet-rope privacy loss, glittery repetition, VIP entitlement, whispery critique, or the strain of always being “on.”

            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Never being truly off. It’s all velvet ropes and watchful spotlights.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> The repetition. Same champagne questions, same glitter cycle.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> The entitlement. People treat access like a VIP pass they bought.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> The criticism. Even tiny side-eyes start feeling like sand in satin.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> The performance. Being “on” starts feeling like wearing a designer mask.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Three interviews saying the same thing in different fonts and fragrances.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Fans crossing a line like you’re part of the package.</label>

          </fieldset>

          <fieldset>
            <legend>Your most honest “over-it” symptom would look like:</legend>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Hypervigilance. I can’t relax in public; I’m always scanning the room.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Numbness. I go glossy and float through it on autopilot.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Irritation. My patience turns sharp and my smile turns expensive.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Rumination. One comment smudges the whole day.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Dissociation. I feel split from the persona—like I’m watching the show.</label>

            <legend>When people say “you signed up for this,” you feel:</legend>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Anger. A contract isn’t a blank check on my humanity.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Tired. They’re not wrong, but it still drains the shine.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Stressed. It makes me want to retreat to something softer.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Small. Like I’m not allowed to be human—only curated.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" disabled> Weird. Like I’m watching my life from the mezzanine.</label>

          <fieldset>
            <legend>Your most likely “wear but make it aesthetic” move would be:</legend>

      Sustained fame isn’t one big dramatic crash — it’s one pressure repeating until it starts to feel pricey.
      Some people fade from constant access. Some from the content runway. Some from VIP entitlement,
      whispery critique, or the strain of performing a polished version of themselves.
      This quiz is a fun, glossy estimate of your likely “shine-drain” — the thing that would dull you first.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your shine-drain trigger:</strong> No-Off-Switch, Repetition, Entitlement, Criticism, or Performance.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your pressure sensitivity:</strong> do comments spike tension or slide into glossed-over numbness?</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Celebrities rarely step back because of one headline. They step back because the same cost keeps reloading:
        flashes at errands, the same interview loop, fans crossing lines, commentary turning into judgment,
        or feeling like you’re trapped in a persona forever. That’s the slow-burn fatigue this quiz is built around.

        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “I can’t do this every day.”

      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Your result isn’t a diagnosis — it’s a vibe pattern.
        It points to the specific pressure that would quietly dull your stamina first, and the move you’d probably default to:
        more boundaries, less access, less output, or a full reinvention just to feel real again.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is there a “best” shine-drain trigger?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. Each one points to a different kind of cost. The useful part is noticing what dulls you fastest.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “No-Off-Switch” mean?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It means constant access: being recognizable, photographed, commented on, and never fully unobserved in public.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why is “Performance” a category?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Because living as a persona can pull you away from yourself. Even positive attention can feel suffocating if it’s for a mask.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going. The next quiz gets existential: would you still feel like yourself without attention?
