    <p class="lead">
      Sustained fame teaches a blunt lesson: controversy can be a growth strategy.
      Outrage boosts reach. Backlash creates spikes. And the temptation shows up eventually —
      especially when attention slows down. This quiz is a fun, glossy look at your likely posture:
      would you use backlash as fuel, manage it carefully, protect your peace, stir chaos, or avoid heat entirely?

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your controversy posture:</strong> Fuel User, Peace Keeper, Strategist, Troll, or Avoider.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your heat tolerance:</strong> do you metabolize outrage or get drained by it?</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        The outrage economy rewards repeatable conflict. The reward is real — reach, clicks, relevance —
        while the cost is real too: your brand gets louder, your vibe gets sharper, and the room starts expecting sparks.
        Some people can live in high-heat attention. Some people prefer low-heat elegance. This quiz maps the style.

      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        This quiz isn’t about “good” or “bad.” It’s about incentives.
        If controversy increases relevance, would you take the deal — and how would you keep it polished instead of messy?
