<h1>What Would You Do When the Story Isn’t Yours Anymore?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    At a certain point, public attention takes on a life of its own.
    This quiz explores how you’d react once headlines, clips, and strangers start shaping your story,
    whether you’d fight back, step away, redirect the narrative, or feel the pressure hit personally.

      Sustained fame has a turning point: the story stops being yours.
      Headlines twist. Clips flatten you. Rumors spread faster than corrections.
      This quiz is a fun, honest look at how you’d react when your public identity has momentum of its own,
      whether you’d fight, detach, reframe, deflect, or spiral under pressure.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your narrative response type:</strong> Fighter, Detacher, Reframer, Deflector, or Spiral.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your control instinct:</strong> clarify and manage vs starve the machine.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your engagement style:</strong> receipts, silence, humor, or redirecting the story.</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Once you’re truly visible, narratives don’t wait for your permission.
        People decide what you “meant,” what you “are,” and what you’re “really like” based on fragments.
        The exhausting part isn’t one bad headline, it’s the constant reloading of the story.

      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Why am I defending myself to strangers?”
        <span class="muted">That’s the sustained-fame problem.</span>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        The internet turns people into characters because characters are easy to repeat.
        Your result isn’t about “strength”, it’s about your likely survival strategy once your image becomes public property.
        Some strategies protect reputation. Some protect peace. Some protect meaning. Some cost you emotionally.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>

      The hardest part of fame isn’t being seen, it’s being narrated.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is it better to respond or stay silent?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Depends. Responding can correct the record but can also extend the news cycle. Silence protects peace but can let bad narratives calcify.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “reframe” mean?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It means you don’t argue every detail, you create a stronger story to replace the weak one: a project, a statement, a pivot, a new chapter.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “deflect” mean?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        You use humor, ambiguity, or vibe control so the narrative can’t fully hook into you, but the trade-off is sometimes looking evasive.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going. The next quiz confronts the uncomfortable question: would you ever use backlash to stay relevant?
