<h1>Would You Trade Visibility for Control?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Early fame nudges you into a choice: stay visible even when your story gets a little sparkly and stretched,
    or pull back to keep your vibe clear and intentional.
    This quiz drops you into that moment, headlines, memes, remixing, and performative pressure,
    and explores whether you’d prioritize reach, clarity, or a slightly awkward middle path
    once attention starts decorating you with its own interpretation.

      Attention doesn’t just add eyes, it adds remixing. Headlines simplify your vibe. Memes turn you into a
      tiny, repeatable character. People pass around a “version” of you that’s close-ish… but not quite you.
      This quiz is a fun, candy-coated check on where you draw the line:
      do you stay visible even if the story gets re-captioned, or do you shrink the spotlight to keep your message crisp,
      your vibe intact, and your boundaries unbothered?

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Early fame is when “you” meets “the internet’s fan edit of you.”
        People don’t snack on nuance, they snack on shortcuts: one clip, one caption, one vibe, one take.
        Your choices here shape whether you stay the author of your image… or become everyone’s favorite remix template.

        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “That’s not even what I meant.”

      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Some people would rather be everywhere than perfectly understood. Some would rather be understood than everywhere.
        Most people think they want “both” until the glitter-cannon starts firing captions they didn’t write.
        Your result shows what you protect first: reach, clarity, comfort, or boundaries.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Visibility is fun, until you realize everyone has their own captions.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is choosing reach “bad”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. It just means you can roll with remixing to stay in the mix. That’s a real skill, and it comes with a real price tag.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is choosing control the same as being insecure?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. It usually means you care about clarity, reputation, and not being turned into a one-note character.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can you actually have both reach and control?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Sometimes, but it’s delicate. The bigger you get, the more people add their own captions and edits whether you asked for them or not.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What do I do with my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going. Next up: whether you’d rather be admired… or be impossible to ignore.
