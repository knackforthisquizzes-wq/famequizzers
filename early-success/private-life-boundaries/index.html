<h1>How Much of You Would End Up Online?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Early attention has a way of softening the edges between what’s yours and what becomes shareable.
    This quiz explores how much of your life would naturally wander online once eyes are on you —
    what you’d keep tucked away, what you’d offer up, and how you’d draw the line as curiosity grows.

      Attention has a sneaky way of turning everyday moments into shareable ones.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your sharing style:</strong> locked down, selective, balanced, open, or flexible.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your comfort zone:</strong> how close you like the audience to feel.</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most people don’t sit down and decide to share everything.
        It happens in small steps — a reply here, a story there, a moment that feels harmless at the time.
        Over time, those choices add up and quietly define how visible your life becomes.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Huh… I didn’t expect to share that.”
        <span class="muted">That’s how lines gently shift.</span>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Privacy isn’t all-or-nothing. It’s negotiated in real time, in public,
        often without a clear rulebook.
        Your result isn’t a judgment — it’s a snapshot of how you’d likely navigate that gray space.

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      What ends up online usually isn’t planned — it’s what feels shareable in the moment.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is sharing more always a mistake?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not at all. Sharing can build warmth and connection — it just changes the shape of what people expect next.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is being very private realistic?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It can be, especially with consistency. Clear patterns tend to teach audiences what not to ask for.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “leak risk” mean here?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It means boundaries that feel solid most of the time, but soften when emotions or momentum run high.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Notice which boundary feels hardest to hold — then keep going. The next quiz looks at who shapes your public image next.
