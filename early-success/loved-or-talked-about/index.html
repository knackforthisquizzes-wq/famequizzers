</nav>

    <p class="lead">
      Early fame turns into a funny little fork in the road: do you want to be respected — or do you want to be unavoidable?
      Some people chase admiration and a clean reputation. Others chase relevance and constant motion.
      This quiz is a playful read on which kind of attention feels most like “winning” to you —
      and whether you prefer a low-temp glow, a medium simmer, or full sparkle-heat.

      <h3>What This Quiz Picks Up On</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your attention preference:</strong> Admired, Talked-About, Both, or Offstage.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your heat level:</strong> do you prefer low, medium, or high-intensity attention?</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your authorship vibe:</strong> do you like steering the story, or letting it stay a little remixable?</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        The internet hands out different kinds of “wins.” Admired people tend to get trust and steady support — but it can feel quiet.
        Talked-about people get reach and momentum — and the timeline keeps moving.
        Early success is basically choosing your flavor: steady glow, trending sparkle, a careful blend, or staying mostly offstage while the work speaks.

        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Wait… is this a compliment or a plot twist?”

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        “Loved” and “talked about” can look similar from the outside (numbers, mentions, screenshots).
        They feel totally different on the inside. One is stable warmth. The other is constant motion.
        Your result is a snapshot of which kind of attention you naturally lean toward — and what trade-offs you tend to make along the way.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      The internet can hand you attention fast — but it usually arrives with confetti and opinions.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is being “talked about” always a bad thing?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not always. It can be a superpower. It just tends to come with louder takes, faster remixing, and more people adding their own captions.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “admired” the calmer form of fame?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Often, yes — it usually runs cooler and steadier. But it can also feel slower and less “loud” than constant relevance.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “offstage” mean here?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It means you prefer the work being valued without becoming a public character. You’ll take attention only if it stays low-key and controlled.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
