      Once attention sticks, a public version of you starts forming whether you like it or not.
      Some people grab the pen and write the character. Others stay loose, resist labels, or get
      quietly reshaped by feedback over time. This quiz explores how you’d handle that pressure —
      and who would really be in control of your public identity.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your identity strategy:</strong> curated, unfiltered, adaptive, or reactive.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your control instinct:</strong> authorship vs crowd-led narrative.</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most celebrity personas aren’t fake — they’re simplified.
        The audience rewards consistency, clarity, and repeatability.
        Over time, that pressure nudges people to perform versions of themselves that “work,”
        even when it costs nuance or inner alignment.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “I didn’t plan to become *this* version of me.”
        <span class="muted">That’s how personas form.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        The real tension isn’t authenticity versus branding — it’s authorship versus drift.
        Your result isn’t a judgment. It’s a snapshot of whether you’d steer your public self,
        collaborate with the audience, or slowly get rewritten by attention itself.
