<h1>Reacting to Sudden Fame</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    This is the first week where attention stops being an idea and starts acting like a calendar invite.
    Comments, clips, expectations, strangers watching — it all arrives at once.
    This quiz maps your default move: do you lean into visibility, pull back for space,
    start shaping the story right away, or hit pause while you catch up?

      This quiz is a fun, honest snapshot of your default first-week style:
      do you lean in, pull back, start shaping perception immediately, or hit pause while you catch up to the pace?

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your first-week reflex:</strong> Lean-In, Pull-Back, Image-Manager, or Overstimulated.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your momentum bias:</strong> do you strike while it’s hot or slow it down?</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Early visibility gets weird because it’s fast. People form takes quickly, and the “you” in public starts moving on its own timeline.
        The challenge isn’t just being noticed — it’s the pace: the constant input, the shortcuts people take,
        and the feeling that you’re supposed to respond like this is normal.
        This quiz is built around those first-week moments.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Wait… I have to respond to this now?”
        <span class="muted">That’s when the pace becomes real.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Your first week sets your pattern. If you lean in, you build momentum.
        If you pull back, you protect your headspace. If you manage, you protect your framing.
        If you pause, you give yourself time to adjust. None are “wrong” — they just have different trade-offs.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      The first week of visibility isn’t about identity — it’s about reflex.
    </p>

  <div class="faq" aria-label="Frequently Asked Questions">
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “overstimulated” a bad result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. It usually means you register volume quickly. That can be self-awareness, not weakness.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does “lean in” mean I’m attention-hungry?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not automatically. Some people simply move fast when the room gets loud.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “image manager” mean?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        You instinctively think in framing: what people will assume, what spreads, and what you want clarified early.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What do I do with my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going — the next quiz turns the first-week pace into the real dilemma: visibility vs control.
