<h1>How Long Would the Attention Feel Fun?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    The beginning of attention is exciting. The real question is how long that excitement sticks around.
    This quiz explores your spotlight style, whether attention keeps energizing you,
    works best in phases, or starts to lose its shine once the novelty wears off.

    This quiz pushes the fantasy to its limit, the moment when the spotlight stops being shiny and starts being… a lot.
  </p>
</nav>

    <p class="lead">
      The first wave of attention is usually exciting, new compliments, new eyes, a little extra main-character energy.
      Then it turns into a pattern: the same questions, the same takes, the same tiny moments becoming “content.”
      This quiz is a fun estimate of your spotlight style, whether attention keeps feeling like fuel,
      becomes manageable background noise, or loses its shine once it’s not new anymore.

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Fame isn’t one dramatic moment, it’s the same day repeating with more people watching.
        The “fun” part usually fades when attention stops being optional: your face becomes a meme,
        your tone becomes a topic, and everything you say gets treated like a headline.
        This quiz is built around those early “wait, this is constant?” moments.

      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        People fantasize about the highlight reel. But the real question is rhythm.
        Some people love constant feedback. Some do best in seasons. Some tap out fast.
        Some keep things private like it’s a rare collectible. Your result is basically your
        “how long does this stay fun?” pattern.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does “Privacy-First” mean I’m weak?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nope. It usually means you like your life to feel like yours. That’s not weakness, that’s a vibe.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “Seasonal” mean?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        You do best in phases. Show up hard for a project, then dip out to live like a normal human again.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “burning out” the same as not wanting fame?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. Sometimes it’s just about volume and repetition, even people who like attention can get tired of the loop.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What do I do with my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going. The next quiz moves from “spotlight rhythm” to the daily reality: what it would feel like to never be anonymous again.
