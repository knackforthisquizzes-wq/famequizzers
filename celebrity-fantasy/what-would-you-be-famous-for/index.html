      Attention has a bad habit of turning a whole person into a tiny label.
      A skill. A vibe. A strong opinion. A one-time moment. A “did you hear about…”
      This quiz is a playful guess at what people would latch onto first — and what kind of buzz it would create.

      <h3>What This Quiz Notices</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your “known for” lane:</strong> skill, presence, belief, moment, or controversy.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your buzz flavor:</strong> cheers vs chatter.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your replay factor:</strong> do people rewatch the details or remix the story?</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your headline hazard:</strong> which part of you gets over-simplified.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How It Plays Out</h3>
      <p>
        Public attention loves shortcuts. It grabs the most repeatable “version” of you and runs with it.
        Sometimes that’s flattering. Sometimes it’s just… efficient.
        Either way, it’s rarely the full picture.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “That’s what they think I’m about?”
        <span class="muted">Yep — the shortcut version.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Fun</h3>
      <p>
        This isn’t a verdict. It’s a vibe-check on which “story about you” would spread fastest —
        the kind of thing people can quote in one sentence and feel like they understand the whole movie.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Public memory isn’t accurate — it’s quick.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this quiz trying to define me?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nope. It’s just guessing what kind of “headline version” of you would travel best.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is there a best result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. Every lane has perks and weirdness. The fun part is noticing what feels most “yep, that tracks.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why mention “cheers vs chatter” and “replay factor”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Because two people can be “known for the same thing” but get totally different energy around it —
        hype, debate, obsession with details, or constant remixing.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep rolling through Phase 1 — next up is how fame finds you in the first place.
