    Attention doesn’t invent a new version of you — it just turns the volume up.

      <h3>What This Quiz Looks For</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Attention posture:</strong> lean in, step back, or stay controlled.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Image instinct:</strong> shape the story or let it unfold.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Privacy line:</strong> what stays yours no matter what.</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why These Moments Matter</h3>
      <p>
        Attention usually announces itself quietly.
        A look. A comment. A phone pointed your way.
        Those first few seconds tend to reveal how you operate long before you think about it.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Huh… that was interesting.”
        <span class="muted">Your reaction right there is the data.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>What You Get Out of It</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll get a clear role — not a ranking.
        Think of it as the character you naturally play when attention enters the room.
        Nothing to fix. Just something to recognize.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Attention doesn’t change your personality — it reveals which parts step forward first.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this quiz only about fame?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. It’s really about being noticed — fame just makes the pattern louder.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is one result better than another?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nope. Different roles create different dynamics. None of them are “correct.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this meant to be serious?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It’s playful, but honest. Think “interesting mirror,” not instruction manual.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going through the sequence. Each quiz zooms out a little more.
