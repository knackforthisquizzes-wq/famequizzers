  <div class="quiz-title">
    Fame doesn’t just change how people see you, it changes how everyday moments play out.
    This quiz drops you into ordinary situations where you’re recognized, noticed, or filmed,
    and explores whether life without anonymity would feel thrilling, awkward,
    intrusive, or just plain strange over time.

      This isn’t “life advice.” It’s a fun, honest snapshot of your default move when you’re noticed.
      When attention shows up, compliments, opinions, side-eyes, random clips, do you lean in,
      keep it controlled, go quiet, or try to steer the moment?

      <h3>What This Quiz Picks Up On</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your attention style:</strong> do you enjoy the spotlight or prefer the edges?</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your control style:</strong> do you shape the story or let it unfold?</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Everyday Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most people don’t think about attention until it’s already happening.
        A glance sticks. A comment lands. A phone comes out. Suddenly you’re aware of yourself.
        This quiz is built around those small moments where your default reaction shows up first.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Wait… are people watching me?”
        <span class="muted">That split second usually reveals your style.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Attention turns the volume up. Some people feel energized by it. Some people keep it tight.
        Some people stay chill. Some people get reactive. Your result is basically a snapshot of how you tend to act
        when you’re being watched, talked about, or turned into a topic.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Attention doesn’t create a new you, it just turns the volume up on the you that’s already there.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this quiz only for people who want fame?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nope. It’s for anyone who’s curious how they handle being noticed, even on a small scale.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is there a “good” result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. Every type has strengths and trade-offs. The point is pattern, not ranking.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this supposed to be serious?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        It’s meant to be fun, but still feel true. Think “personality snapshot,” not “rules for your life.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What do I do with my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Enjoy it, and notice what felt accurate. That’s usually the most interesting part.
