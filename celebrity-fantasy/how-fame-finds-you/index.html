    This quiz sits in the middle of Phase 1, where attention stops being a mystery and starts looking like a system.
  </p>
</nav>

    <p class="lead">
      Fame usually starts in a way that feels a little random: a clipped moment, a slow-build reputation,
      a stranger posting you, or a rollout you planned carefully. This quiz is a fun guess at
      your most likely “origin story”, and whether the opening chapter would look fast or slow,
      guided or chaotic, and low-key or very public.

      <h3>What This Quiz Picks Up On</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your fame origin:</strong> Viral Hit, Slow Burn, Caught On Camera, or Planned Launch.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your speed pattern:</strong> does attention spike fast or build slowly?</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your control style:</strong> are you steering the story or responding to it?</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most famous people don’t get famous the way they pictured it. Algorithms grab the weirdest moment.
        Strangers post you without warning. Or you build quietly for years and then suddenly everyone acts like
        you appeared out of nowhere. The beginning is messy, and it sets the tone for what comes next.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “Wait… THIS is the thing they latched onto?”
        <span class="muted">Yep. The internet loves a repeatable moment.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        The start matters. Viral attention creates a different vibe than slow-build credibility.
        Being “caught on camera” feels different than launching on purpose. Your result is basically a snapshot
        of how attention would most likely reach you first, and how you’d play the first wave.

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      The internet doesn’t reward the best moment, it rewards the moment it can repeat.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “planned launch” the only real way to get famous?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not at all. A lot of attention is accidental, and even a planned rollout can get hijacked by one random clip.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is viral fame always faster than slow-burn fame?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Usually, yes. But slow-build attention can still flip suddenly when one moment makes people look back at your whole body of work.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What does “caught on camera” mean here?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Fame that starts through someone else posting you, filmed, quoted, tagged, or turned into a story, before you planned it.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do after I get my result?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Keep going in the series. Next up is the real test: how long attention stays fun once it stops being new.
