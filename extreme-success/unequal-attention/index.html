<h1>How Would You Handle Unequal Attention?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention rarely spreads itself evenly.
    This quiz plays with what happens when praise, visibility, and credit cluster around you,
    how you move in the spotlight, smooth the room, deflect the glare, or simply let the weather pass.

    <p class="lead">
      Unequal attention is one of the most common side-effects of a big moment: praise concentrates, credit gets blurry,
      and the social temperature shifts.
      This quiz explores whether you’d polish the credit, protect your lane, detach from the weather, or quietly carry the awkwardness.

      <h3>What This Quiz Picks Up On</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your spotlight style:</strong> credit-polishing, blame-deflecting, weather-watching, or genuinely confused.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your credit reflex:</strong> correct, balance, let it slide, or redistribute.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your room-management instinct:</strong> smooth things over vs hold your ground.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your vibe under praise:</strong> warm, tense, detached, or strategically gracious.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        At scale, attention behaves like a narrow-beam spotlight: teams get flattened into faces, collaboration becomes a headline,
        and “credit” turns into something people argue about in comment sections.
        Even nice praise can create weirdness if it keeps landing on the same person.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “I didn’t choose this imbalance.”
        <span class="muted">True, but you still have to move inside it.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Most people imagine success as a personal upgrade.
        Unequal attention reveals the social side: awkward silences, status drift, and the subtle pressure to manage a story you didn’t write.
        Your result shows how you’d keep the vibe (and your relationships) intact when the spotlight won’t share.
