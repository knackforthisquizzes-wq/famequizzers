    Big wins always come with a story — and the internet loves to write it for you.
    This quiz plays with how you frame your success: pure craft, perfect timing, a sparkly mix of both,

      Big wins come with a storyline — and it rarely stays under your control.
      Some people demand receipts, some credit timing, some carry a quiet wobble, and some simply glide past the noise.
      This quiz maps your “win narrative” style once the story starts writing itself.

      <h3>What This Quiz Tunes Into</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your win-story style:</strong> receipts-ready, systems-savvy, mixed-truth, story-wobbly, or unbothered.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your framing instinct:</strong> defend, explain, stylize, or disengage.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your “fidget factor”:</strong> how much the narrative gets under your skin.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your signature risk:</strong> over-proving, over-explaining, over-cynic-ing, or over-floating.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up Day-to-Day</h3>
      <p>
        Success can look clean from the outside while feeling surprisingly editorial on the inside.
        You might keep receipts, keep it nuanced, keep it mechanical, or keep it glamorously brief.
        These patterns shape how you respond to praise, comments, and that one person who “just asks a question.”
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common vibe:</strong> “I know what I did — I just don’t know how much explaining I owe.”
        <span class="muted">That’s the Phase 4 energy.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Fun to Notice</h3>
      <p>
        The story you tell yourself about success changes how it feels to carry it.
        Some narratives feel grounding. Some feel slippery. Some feel like a performance you didn’t audition for.
