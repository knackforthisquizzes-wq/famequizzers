      <h3>What This Quiz Tunes Into</h3>

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your scale response:</strong> expand, protect, systemize, doubt, or resist.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your vibe under pressure:</strong> energized vs weighed-down.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your structure instinct:</strong> delegation, clean rules, or quiet retreat.</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up Day-to-Day</h3>
      <p>
        People assume “more success” is just more of the same.
        But scale changes the rules: privacy thins out, choices stack up, and the spotlight starts deciding the tempo.
        This is the zone where you either build a new operating system — or push back hard.

        <strong>Common vibe:</strong> “This got bigger than my plan.”
        <span class="muted">That’s the Phase 4 doorway.</span>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Fun to Notice</h3>
      <p>
        Plenty of people want attention. Fewer plan for its upper bounds.
        Your result isn’t about talent — it’s about style: how you handle scale when visibility, influence,
        and expectations all arrive at once.
