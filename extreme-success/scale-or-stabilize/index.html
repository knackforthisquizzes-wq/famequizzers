<h1>Should You Keep Scaling — or Stabilize?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    When success is already huge, the next move isn’t obvious.
    This quiz explores whether you’d keep pushing growth, lock in a calmer lane,
    build systems to contain scale, pause at the crossroads, or step away quietly.

      Extreme success creates a fork most people never plan for.
      More growth is available — and so is the option to lock in a life that still feels like yours.
      This quiz maps your style: scale-forward, stability-first, structured-growth, pause-at-the-crossroads, or quiet exit.

      <h3>What This Quiz Tunes Into</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your default path:</strong> scale, stabilize, hybrid, freeze, or exit.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your “more” appetite:</strong> expansion vs preservation.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your boundary style:</strong> how you handle privacy, pace, and access.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your long-game tension:</strong> upside, calm, control, uncertainty, or freedom.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Plenty of people don’t lose success — they lose the lifestyle it creates.
        Scaling asks for more output and more availability. Stabilizing asks for more “no.”
        This quiz is a mirror for that choice: growth, balance, structure, pause, or a quiet step back.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common vibe:</strong> “If I stop now, will I miss the moment?”
        <span class="muted">That question keeps a lot of winners sprinting past “enough.”</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        “More” is the default story. But after a certain point, taste matters more than speed.
        Your result isn’t a verdict — it’s a snapshot of how you’d style your win: bigger, calmer, cleaner, paused, or private.
