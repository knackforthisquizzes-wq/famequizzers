<h1>What Would People Reduce You To in the End?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention doesn’t keep the full picture, it keeps the shorthand.
    A skill, a look, a quote, or a vibe that’s easier to repeat than the whole story.
    This quiz plays with that idea and explores which version of you would likely stick
    once details blur and memory simplifies.

      <h3>How This Shows Up</h3>
      <p>
        The thing people quote isn’t always the thing you care about most.
        Sometimes it’s the cleanest clip, the sharpest line, the most repostable frame.
        This quiz leans into that: not the whole you, the version that travels.

      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Classic moment:</strong> “That’s not the whole story.”
        <span class="muted">Correct. The internet is allergic to “whole.”</span>

      <h3>Why This Is Fun (and Useful)</h3>
      <p>
        When you know your likely shorthand, you can decide how much you want to feed it.
        Some people love being a symbol. Others want the work to do the talking.
        Either way, it’s a vibe map, not a verdict.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is being “reduced” automatically a bad thing?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">

        The real question is whether the shorthand feels close enough to your vibe.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can I control what people remember?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        You can influence it, not own it.
        People repeat what’s simplest, punchiest, and most portable.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “Enigma” just a fancy word for “misunderstood”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Sometimes, yes. Distance can keep you protected,
        and also invites people to fill in blanks with fanfic.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes next?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next up: where you actually fit in the attention world, niche, mid-level, wide-scale, or rare outlier.
