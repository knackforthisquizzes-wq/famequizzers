<h1>Would You Burn Bright — or Last?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention always comes with a trade-off.
    Some people love big spikes and bold moments, others prefer a long, steady run,
    some move in seasons, and some keep things intentionally low-key.
    This quiz plays with that fork in the road:
    go all-in on intensity — or stretch things out over time.

      Every public arc has a shape.

      <h3>What This Quiz Covers</h3>

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your arc preference:</strong> peak, long-run, chapters, or low-key.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your pace style:</strong> sprinting, steady rhythm, or seasonal bursts.</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most careers don’t fail in one dramatic moment — they drift.
        The arc you prefer changes what you say yes to: projects, pace, exposure, and reinvention.
        This quiz is a fast way to name the kind of run you’d actually choose.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common thought:</strong> “I want the moment… but I also want my life.”
        <span class="muted">That’s the trade-off in plain language.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why This Is Useful</h3>
      <p>
        People talk about visibility like it’s one thing.
        It isn’t.
        A short peak, a long run, seasonal chapters, and staying low-key are totally different games.
        Knowing which game you’d rather play makes everything cleaner.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Visibility is a pacing choice — the “best” arc is the one you’d actually enjoy living in.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “burn bright” always a bad idea?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. It can be exactly right for certain projects and eras.
        The point is choosing it on purpose — not by accident.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does “lasting” mean playing it safe?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. Lasting often means focus, craft, and smart choices — not smaller ambition.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if I choose “low-key”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        That usually means you like space, control, and a lighter public footprint.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes next?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next up: what it might feel like when the attention fades.
