      Most people imagine fame as a moment. But what sticks is the arc.
      This quiz looks past the first break and into the long run, the rhythms, the reinventions,
      the steady builds, and the quieter lanes that keep going.
      Your result describes the kind of trajectory that matches your style, not a “best” path.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your arc type:</strong> steady, wave-shaped, brief, or quietly enduring.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your pace preference:</strong> spikes vs. long-game consistency.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your reinvention style:</strong> steady craft, big pivots, or one defining moment.</li>

      <h3>How This Plays Out in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Most public careers don’t end in one dramatic scene, they drift, stall, pivot, or settle into a lane.
        The people who “last” aren’t always the loudest; they’re the ones who choose a rhythm they can keep.

      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common realization:</strong> “I didn’t plan for the middle years.”

      <h3>Why This Is a Turning Point</h3>
      <p>
        This is where the fantasy becomes a shape.
        Once you can name your likely arc, the next question gets sharper:
        do you want a big moment, a long run, seasons, or a quieter lane?

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is one arc objectively better than the others?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. Each arc has its own trade-offs. This is about style, not status.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Can someone switch arcs later?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Sometimes. Switching usually means changing your pace, your visibility level, or how often you reinvent.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does a quiet arc mean less impact?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. Quiet arcs often outlast louder ones and can shape smaller spaces more deeply.
