<h1>Where Do You Actually Fit in the Attention World?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Not all attention feels the same.
    Some people love a tight niche with familiar faces, others prefer a steady hum of visibility,
    and a few don’t mind the big, bright spotlight.
    This quiz is a playful tour of the attention landscape, a vibe-check on what kinds of visibility sound fun,
    workable, and worth it for you. No ranking. No hype. Just clarity.

      <h3>How It Looks Out in the Wild</h3>
      <p>
        People don’t just “get attention”, they get a specific kind of attention.
        A small, invested crowd hits differently than a steady hum.
        A big spotlight hits differently than a rare pop-in moment.
        This quiz is about recognizing the difference.

      <h3>Why It’s Fun to Know</h3>
      <p>
        There’s no “best” tier.
        Niche can be powerful.
        Mid-level can be steady.
        Wide-scale can be electric.
        Rare exposure can be pure control.
        The point is picking the kind of attention you actually want to live with.
