<h1>How Would You Feel After the Attention Faded?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Most people imagine the spotlight. Fewer think about what comes after.
    This quiz plays in the quiet that follows — the slower pace, the memories,
    and the shift in how life feels once the noise drops.
    Would it feel like relief, loss, resentment, or an unexpected sense of calm?

      The spotlight doesn’t always “end” — it just drifts elsewhere.
      This quiz plays with what the quieter era feels like: the vibe shift, the nostalgia,
      the irritation, the freedom, or the calm that sneaks up on you.
      No moral, no warning label — just an emotional temperature check.

      <h3>What This Quiz Shows</h3>

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your dominant post-spotlight vibe:</strong> relief, loss, resentment, or grounded calm.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your reset style:</strong> privacy, connection, control, or reinvention.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your “cool-down speed”:</strong> whether feelings linger or pass quickly.</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up</h3>
      <p>
        The post-spotlight era is rarely one clean emotion.
        Quiet can feel like freedom one day and weird emptiness the next.
        This quiz is built for that messy mix.

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        The “after” is where your real preferences show up.
        Some people love the calm. Some miss the hum. Some want control.
        Some just keep living like it was a season and not a definition.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is it normal to miss attention?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Missing the buzz doesn’t mean you’re shallow — it means you noticed the buzz.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does relief mean I’m “not built for” visibility?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. It can just mean you love quiet and autonomy more than constant noise.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What if I feel resentment?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        That usually means you care about fairness, effort, or how the story gets told — not that you’re “bad.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes next?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next up: what people would reduce you to in the end — the final “headline” version.
