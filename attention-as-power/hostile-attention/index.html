<h1>What Would People Actually Know You For?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention doesn’t remember everything — it remembers highlights.
    A quote, a moment, a vibe, a role people can easily repeat.
    This quiz takes a playful look at what would stick if you were seen at scale:
    the things people would reference, joke about, or instantly associate with you.

      This quiz is a playful look at your default “backlash style” — whether you jump in, set limits,
      keep quiet, or step back while things cool off.

      <h3>How This Shows Up Online</h3>
      <p>
        Backlash isn’t one thing — it can be criticism, running jokes, or people arguing about your “tone.”
        At scale, even small moments can get repeated, remixed, and turned into a storyline.
        This quiz looks at what you’d naturally do when that storyline starts getting loud.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common moment:</strong> “Wait… is this about what I did, or what people think it means?”

      <h3>Why It’s Fun</h3>
      <p>
        Some people are built for direct replies. Some people prefer one statement and silence.
        Some people keep their head down. Some people take a break from the spotlight entirely.
        Your result is basically your “public reaction archetype.”

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      When attention gets messy, your move matters as much as the moment that started it.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is backlash always about something real?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not always. Sometimes it’s about a real mistake. Sometimes it’s a misread. Sometimes it’s just the internet being the internet.
        This quiz is about your response style, not who’s “right.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is it better to respond or stay silent?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        There isn’t one best move. Some situations reward clarity. Some situations reward distance.
        Your result shows what you’d naturally do first.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does stepping back mean you “lost”?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Nope. Sometimes stepping back is just choosing not to perform for the comment section.
        It’s a style choice, not a scoreboard.
      </div>
