<h1>How Accountable Would You Feel for Your Influence?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention doesn’t just amplify you — it adds momentum.
    Once people start quoting you, copying you, or using your name as context,
    influence becomes part of the picture whether you asked for it or not.
    This quiz looks at how you’d relate to that weight:
    how much responsibility you’d take for what your visibility sets in motion.

</nav>

    <p class="lead">
      Attention can turn a casual comment into a template.
      Once people start copying you, quoting you, or treating your tone like “permission,”
      you’re no longer just expressing yourself — you’re part of the signal other people use.
      This quiz explores how you’d relate to that: step in as a steward, manage it with boundaries,
      keep it hands-off, or reduce how available you are.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your engagement style:</strong> intervene publicly, clarify once, stay silent, or step back.</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Influence isn’t only what you say — it’s what people think you’re signaling.
        At scale, strangers will attach your name to ideas, products, causes, and interpretations,
        including ones you never intended. The tension is the gap between your intent
        and the way your visibility gets used by other people.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common moment:</strong> “Wait… people are building meaning off what I said.”
        <span class="muted">That’s influence showing up.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Lots of people imagine fame as visibility. The sharper question is responsibility.
        Some people treat influence like a duty. Some manage it with clean boundaries.
        Some refuse the burden entirely. Some step back because being “used” as a symbol
        feels like losing control of the story.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      The spotlight gets heavy when people treat your presence like a signal they can act on.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does “Moral Neutralist” mean I don’t care?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not necessarily. It usually means you draw a hard line between what you say and what other people choose to do with it.
        The trade-off is that public interpretation doesn’t always respect that line.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “Steward” the same as being controlling?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. It usually means you assume your platform has ripple effects, so you try to be careful about what you amplify and endorse.
        It’s less “control everyone,” more “don’t be reckless with a megaphone.”
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why does influence feel intense even when I’m not trying to influence?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Because at scale, people treat everything as a signal — even jokes, silence, and offhand comments.
        Attention turns ordinary expression into something other people can copy or quote.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes after this quiz?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next up: what you’d be willing to change to stay relevant — because responsibility creates pressure,
        and pressure creates adaptation.
