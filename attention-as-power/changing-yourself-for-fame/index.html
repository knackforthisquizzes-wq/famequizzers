      <h3>How This Shows Up Online</h3>
      <p>
        Online attention is basically a scoreboard with mood swings.
        When a certain version of you gets rewarded, it’s tempting to do more of that.
        The tricky part is keeping the updates intentional instead of accidental.
        This quiz is built around that exact “do I pivot or do I pass?” moment.
      </p>
      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common moment:</strong> “Wait… am I updating my vibe, or is the vibe updating me?”

    </div>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Fun</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone says they’d “stay authentic.”
        Then the numbers drop, the platform changes, and suddenly a “small tweak” looks very tempting.
        Some people love the pivot. Some people keep it consistent. Some people test five versions and pick the one that lands.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      The easiest changes are the tiny “just this once” tweaks that quietly become the new default.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is adapting the same as being fake?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not automatically. Adapting can just mean updating format, tone, or style.
        “Fake” is when you’re doing something that feels like a total costume.
        This quiz is just a fun way to see where your personal “costume line” is.
