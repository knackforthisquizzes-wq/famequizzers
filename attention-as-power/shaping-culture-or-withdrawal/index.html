<h1>Would You Shape Culture — or Quietly Back Away?</h1>

<div class="quiz-container">
  <div class="quiz-title">
    Attention turns into leverage faster than people expect.
    Once your words and silence both carry weight, you have a choice:
    step into influence and help shape culture, engage with strict limits,
    stay hands-off, or pull back entirely to reduce exposure.
    This quiz maps where you’d land when visibility becomes power.

      People expect leadership, opinions, and “meaning” from your silence.

      stay hands-off, or pull back entirely when the weight starts to feel real.

        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your engagement level:</strong> how vocal you’d be when issues explode.</li>

      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        The internet doesn’t treat visibility as neutral.
        If you’re famous, people assume your voice matters — and then get mad when you use it “wrong,” or don’t use it at all.
        Some people lean into that pressure and become culture-shapers.
        Some engage carefully, trying not to become a full-time public leader.
        Some refuse the role entirely. Some retreat because it starts taking over their life.

        <strong>Common moment:</strong> “Wait… my silence is being used as a statement.”

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Influence feels flattering until it becomes expectation.
        Once people treat you like a moral symbol, your options shrink.
        Your result shows whether you’d carry that weight, manage it with boundaries,
        refuse to play the role, or step back before it rewires your life.

    <h3>One-Sentence Insight</h3>
    <p>
      Influence isn’t power you “have” — it’s pressure you have to carry.

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Does “Non-Participant” mean I don’t care about anything?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Not at all. It usually means you don’t want a public platform to become a moral authority.
        You may care deeply — you just prefer private action over public signaling.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is “Withdrawer” just fear?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Sometimes it’s fear. Often it’s self-protection.
        Influence can become a job you never applied for, and withdrawal can be a boundary strategy.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is it “better” to shape culture?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        There’s no moral score here.
        Shaping culture can create impact, but it also attracts backlash, misreads, and pressure.
        The point is knowing what you’d actually do, not what sounds noble.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes next?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next up: hostile attention — because influence attracts resistance, and criticism.
        That’s where “power” stops being theoretical.
