<h1>How Would You Handle Being Misread by Millions?</h1>

  <div class="quiz-title">
    At scale, people don’t just watch — they interpret.
    A wrong take can travel fast, strangers debate your intent,
    and a simplified version of you can take on a life of its own.
    This quiz looks at how you’d respond when that happens:
    would you correct the story, guide perception selectively,
    shrug and move on, or step back from the noise?

    <p class="lead">
      At scale, people don’t just misunderstand — they simplify.
      A clip travels faster than context. A repeated story starts to feel official.
      This quiz looks at how you’d respond when interpretation replaces intent:
      whether you’d correct the story, guide perception selectively,
      treat it as background noise, or limit access altogether.

      <h3>What This Quiz Picks Up On</h3>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your narrative stance:</strong> correct, manage, accept, or step back.</li>
        <li><span class="bullet"></span><strong>Your engagement style:</strong> how much public clarification you’re willing to do.</li>

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>How This Shows Up in Real Life</h3>
      <p>
        Once scale enters the picture, interpretation becomes collaborative.
        People debate your intent, remix fragments of you,
        and build versions that live independently of your actual choices.
        The challenge isn’t hostility — it’s loss of control over meaning.

      <div class="mini-note">
        <strong>Common realization:</strong> “That’s not what I said… but that’s what stuck.”

    <div class="info-card">
      <h3>Why It’s Interesting</h3>
      <p>
        Some people insist on accuracy.
        Some guide perception with structure.
        Some opt out of the argument entirely.
        Some reduce exposure so fewer stories form.
        Your result shows how you’d operate once misunderstanding becomes structural.

      <summary>Is correcting people always worth it?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Why does misunderstanding feel different from criticism?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Criticism reacts to what you did.
        Misunderstanding reacts to a version of you that exists only in repetition.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is stepping back a failure?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        No. Limiting access is a visibility strategy.
        Less exposure means fewer narratives — but also less control over the ones that remain.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What comes next?</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Next: influence versus withdrawal — what you do once attention stops being passive
        and starts shaping outcomes.
